# Example of overlapping QGraphicsItem and hover events

This repository contains a basic example of what I am trying to accomplish in QT with respect to resizing an image. I have a basic (but buggy) version of code that adds two QGraphicsItems to a scene. The images can be moved around and can be resized. I'm trying to figure out how to allow the hoverMoveEvent to propagate to the GraphicsItem that is being occluded.
